{"name":"Doc Docs","tagline":"A \"stack-overflow\"esk site which will soon collect data on the accuracy of online documentation/articles for the purpose of warning users when they arrive to out of date or incorrect material and point them in a better direction if possible.","body":"# Doc Doc[ument]s\r\n### By: Michael Rosata.\r\n\r\nOpensource documentation and articles fuel the drive for knowledge in anyone who has a spark to learn.\r\nEveryday there are people who write articles sharing the knowledge they found back to the\r\ncommunity which paved the way for their own successes. *all praise o.s.* As an FYI, the remainder of this \r\ndocumentation I will use the word \"materials\" to describe a webpage which provides documentation, \r\nan article or other resource of information.\r\n\r\n#### Who is watching the watchers?\r\nJust because material is great doesn't mean that its accuracy and relavance will be preserved with time. \r\nMaterial which you read today may not even be correct, maybe it was at one time and maybe it never had been. \r\nStack Overflow does an amazing job at cataloging community Q&A and displaying tracked community approval and popularity \r\ndata. Doc Docs \"DD\" wishes to perform a similar feat but in the realm of reference materials \r\n(docs, articles, blog posts).\r\nThis project is under heavy development right now, but so far it's moving at a decent pace. Being that it's a \r\nside project there will be gaps with my dev and iteration time but this is happening one way or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nA phenomena known as \"Doc rot\", informational materials grow stale over time, best practices change and technologies \r\nexpand or collapse, the community migrates into new standards. But the rate of decay is often quicker than the rate at \r\nwhich that same material drops from search listings and external links. Keeping up on learning and research is time \r\nconsuming enough without having to do research \r\non the material which you use to do research on other material you'r trying to learn. \r\n(*I mean that's painful just to think about really*). \r\nSo Doc Docs will have a website, but more importantly Doc Docs will integrate into your browser so you can be \r\nwarned without adding another link in the search chain (so to speak). \r\nLet the Doc Docs community do the research and hopefully people who find it useful will contribute \r\ntheir findings as well.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nFirst we start by collecting ratings and reviews for online articles and documentation. Anyone will be able to search \r\nthe Doc docs archives for material reviews, but where Doc docs will shine is through browser extensions\r\nwhich can inform users in real time about the quality of the material that they are currently about to read and \r\neven offer safer alternatives to the currently loaded article if possible. These alternatives are called \"detours\". \r\nA detour is a url of another material which teaches on the same niche but with better or more reliable information. \r\nDetours must route users to material covering the same topic, different standards perhaps but never different \r\ntechnologies. IE: a Python material detour may never route a user to a NodeJS material page centered around the same \r\nconcept. \r\n\r\nEvery review, rating or detour a user makes adds to their trustworthiness and other users may vote up/down another \r\nusers review which will help the Doc Docs community build faith in recomendations.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust like on Stack overflow you will be able to see the contribution level of the users who have reviewed\r\ndocumentation and the \"ups\" and \"downs\" voted on their ranking/review by the community members. As time \r\nprogresses the older rating levels will begin to hold less weight over newer ratings, so a user with a \r\nmid-level trust ranking could offset a user with a high trust ranking if the higher ranked user cast their \r\nopinion a long time ago. This time factoring will be adjusted more if a document has been branded \"outdated\"\r\nby the community and   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Development Progress, How to test Doc Docs today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Michael Rosata](mrosata1984@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-51138602-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
