<p>Opensource documentation and articles fuel the drive for knowledge in anyone who has a spark to learn.
Everyday there are people who write articles sharing the knowledge they found back to the
community which paved the way for their own successes. <em>all praise o.s.</em> As an FYI, the remainder of this 
documentation I will use the word "materials" to describe a webpage which provides documentation, 
an article or other resource of information.</p>

<p>Just because material is great doesn't mean that its accuracy and relavance will be preserved with time. 
Material which you read today may not even be correct, maybe it was at one time and maybe it never had been. 
Stack Overflow does an amazing job at cataloging community Q&amp;A and displaying tracked community approval and popularity 
data. Doc Docs "DD" wishes to perform a similar feat but in the realm of reference materials 
(docs, articles, blog posts).
This project is under heavy development right now, but so far it's moving at a decent pace. Being that it's a 
side project there will be gaps with my dev and iteration time but this is happening one way or another.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>A phenomena known as "Doc rot", informational materials grow stale over time, best practices change and technologies 
expand or collapse, the community migrates into new standards. But the rate of decay is often quicker than the rate at 
which that same material drops from search listings and external links. Keeping up on learning and research is time 
consuming enough without having to do research 
on the material which you use to do research on other material you'r trying to learn. 
(<em>I mean that's painful just to think about really</em>). 
So Doc Docs will have a website, but more importantly Doc Docs will integrate into your browser so you can be 
warned without adding another link in the search chain (so to speak). 
Let the Doc Docs community do the research and hopefully people who find it useful will contribute 
their findings as well.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how" class="anchor" href="#how" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How?</h3>

<p>First we start by collecting ratings and reviews for online articles and documentation. Anyone will be able to search 
the Doc docs archives for material reviews, but where Doc docs will shine is through browser extensions
which can inform users in real time about the quality of the material that they are currently about to read and 
even offer safer alternatives to the currently loaded article if possible. These alternatives are called "detours". 
A detour is a url of another material which teaches on the same niche but with better or more reliable information. 
Detours must route users to material covering the same topic, different standards perhaps but never different 
technologies. IE: a Python material detour may never route a user to a NodeJS material page centered around the same 
concept. </p>

<p>Every review, rating or detour a user makes adds to their trustworthiness and other users may vote up/down another 
users review which will help the Doc Docs community build faith in recomendations.</p>

<p>Just like on Stack overflow you will be able to see the contribution level of the users who have reviewed
documentation and the "ups" and "downs" voted on their ranking/review by the community members. As time 
progresses the older rating levels will begin to hold less weight over newer ratings, so a user with a 
mid-level trust ranking could offset a user with a high trust ranking if the higher ranked user cast their 
opinion a long time ago. This time factoring will be adjusted more if a document has been branded "outdated"
by the community and   </p>
