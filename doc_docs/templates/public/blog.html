            The OAuth2 logins/signups are now done for Facebook, Google and GitHub. I think that
            is a good enough amount of login options for now. I feel some of the code which I
            wrote a couple months ago was a bit hackish and have set about fixing it. Mainly
            there are a couple queries which use joins to get data aggregated for the templates
            and they don't have to use joins because SQLAlchemy holds relationships in the
            objects returned from the queries.

            I have done some work here or there the past month to DocDocs but I've been otherwise
            engaged with other projects. There is a set amount of progress I need to make on this
            project though as well so I'm back at it. I want to have all the basic User
            interactions and functionalities set up.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have finished the web scraping for collection of <code>og:meta</code> information
            when users are adding new docs. I also worked out the ability for users to be able to
            edit their Doc Reviews. In the future I plan to limit this ability to a 24 hour
            window after a review has been written. At the moment I am adding a delete button
            that will also be limited by the same restrictions in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step after that is to make sure that all the areas of the website where
            reviews are being displayed are showing the correct information. I have started to
            write unit tests for logging on and for review creation. I'll write some unit tests
            for the Editing and Delete features as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            A final note, I have the <a href="http://doc-docs.herokuapp.com/blog">app up on
            heroku now</a>.

            I feel like the site is far enough along to give it some posts. Just a few short snippets of work that is
            underway. Today I worked out some kinks in the registration, I had wanted for login and registration to be
            inside nav bar modals and be submitted from and handled by to the root index page. I had an alright system
            going but in the end reverted to using a /register url which is a fallback to or alternative of the modal
            registration on index page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I've abstracted a lot of the apps work into objects which are making managing everything a lot easier.
            Last night I created a python script to run interactively for on the fly testing. The script is rough at the
            moment but it allows for quick access to the db to run querys. I'd like to build up some request context
            testing functions. The site uses Flask, Flask-Security with Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy and so
            on. Right now in development I'm using SQLite but that's a very very temporary solution. If your reading
            this the db engine has probably already been switched. Aiming to use Postgres most likely or some other
            flavor of SQL
          </p>
          <p>
            Tonight I'm trying to build the scraper to bring in images and demo content for DocDocs. I'll update later
            when that is finished or tomorrow.
