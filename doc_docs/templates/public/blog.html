            I feel like the site is far enough along to give it some posts. Just a few short snippets of work that is
            underway. Today I worked out some kinks in the registration, I had wanted for login and registration to be
            inside nav bar modals and be submitted from and handled by to the root index page. I had an alright system
            going but in the end reverted to using a /register url which is a fallback to or alternative of the modal
            registration on index page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I've abstracted a lot of the apps work into objects which are making managing everything a lot easier.
            Last night I created a python script to run interactively for on the fly testing. The script is rough at the
            moment but it allows for quick access to the db to run querys. I'd like to build up some request context
            testing functions. The site uses Flask, Flask-Security with Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy and so
            on. Right now in development I'm using SQLite but that's a very very temporary solution. If your reading
            this the db engine has probably already been switched. Aiming to use Postgres most likely or some other
            flavor of SQL
          </p>
          <p>
            Tonight I'm trying to build the scraper to bring in images and demo content for DocDocs. I'll update later
            when that is finished or tomorrow.
