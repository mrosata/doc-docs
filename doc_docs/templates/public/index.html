        <h2>The Why.</h2>
        <p>
          The online community is fantastic about posting documentation, it is part of the reason that we make new
          progress so often.  New standards are constantly being implemented and with that change comes entirely new
          principles of best practice. An article written last year might not be as accurate as when it was first
          written.  Comments can be a good indicator of an articles correctness, however, comments normally display the
          earliest comments at the top and the comments thereafter get buried in arguments and one-off debates. There
          should be a way to know what the community thinks about an articles accuracy before reading it... and now there
          is.

        <h3>The What</h3>
        <p>
          Doc-docs will keep track of what the community thinks about articles around the web and catalog those reviews,
          ratings, and also the authors who write them. Just like the standards which are in constant flux, the Doc-docs
          system will evolve over time to try to fit the times. Similar to the way which
          <a href="//stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> not only tracks the "ups" and "downs" on an
          answer, they track the contribution of authors.  We at Doc-docs intend to do the same with our reviewers.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually the entire Doc-docs experience should be integrated into your browsing flow so that you never have to
          actually have to take extra steps towards checking the accuracty of a document or the trustworthiness of the
          ratings, reviews and detours listed on an article. Hopefully the usefulness of our archives and browser plugin
          will attract a large community and effortlessly people will always find the best documentation sources online.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3>The How</h3>
        <p>
          When you search for or surf to an article which has been classified inaccurate or outdated by other members of
          the Doc-Docs community a non-obtrusive flag will briefly appear telling you as much. You will have the ability
          to check any flag to find out how the article became flagged and by whom. In addition, users are able to cast
          votes on both articles/documentation they read and also reviews written by Doc-docs members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any rating, review or detours author will have an accessible profile for viewing and will be avialable from
          both the plugin and the main website.
          If an article has not been rated or reviewed and you would like to be the first to make a rating it would help
          to lead future readers in the right direction based on your approval or disapproval.
          Votes from users who contribute more often will hold more weight.
          Doc-docs provides a quick
          1 - 10 rating system through a 5 star graphical display. You also can write reviews, comment on your rating and
          provide alternatives to the current documentation in the form of a url called a "detour".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-4 columns">
        <h3>The Plan</h3>
        <p>
          For the time being Doc-docs is soley available via our web platform. A browser plugin is in development for the
          Chrome internet browser. Community members are not only encouraged to start reviewing and rating docs that they
          run across in their day to day routines and encouraging other communitys to join the initiative and to do the
          same. This product is all about knowledge and helping the open-source community. In that spirit it will always
          be a free service. Additionally, we hope that community members will help develop the Doc-docs platform by
          creating browser extensions to for additional browsers so that users don't have to interface with the main
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a lot of features in the planning stage and we welcome developers to
          <a href="{{ url_for("public.discussion") }}">join in on the discussion</a>.
          The main goal at Doc-docs is to make life easier and bad information scarcer for those out there who build
          the tech which powers our world and for those who aspire to do as much. We are Doc-docs and we are community.
