        While you should try your best to write a good and accurate review the first time, we do
        understand that there are times when you either change your mind or realize that a mistake
        may have been made and so we will give you the opportunity to edit your review for 24 hours
        after writing it. After that point you will have to delete the review from the system and
        write a new one. I assure you that this is in the best interest of this site and its users.
