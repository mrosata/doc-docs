        Hey there good citizen. If you delete this review it could impact your overall community
        standing by a fraction. No big deal really, but I wouldn't make a habit out of it. Since
        we are still fairly new the penality isn't that harsh, 5 point deduction
        <code>while points &gt;= 0</code>. In the future these rules could change, are you sure
        you want to delete this review? You could always just <a href="{{
          url_for('public.edit_review', review_id=review.doc_review_id)
        }}">edit the review</a>.
      </p>
