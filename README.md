# Doc Doc[ument]s
### A Michael does Udacity production.

Opensource documentation and articles fuel the drive for knowledge in anyone who has a spark to learn.
Everyday there are people who write articles sharing the knowledge they found back to the
community which paved the way for their own successes. *all praise o.s.*

#### But who is watching the watchers?
So that article which you read today may not even be correct, maybe it was at one time and maybe it never had been. 
Stack Overflow does an amazing job at archiving questions and answers and then allowing the
community to moderate those answer. Doc docs "DD" wants to do for OS documentation what SO did for OS questions.
This project is under heavy development right now, but so far it's moving at a decent pace. Hopefully no one tries to 
pay me to do work anytime soon so I may continue to develop in isolation `;p`


### Why?
A phenomena known as "Doc rot", information grows stale over time, best practices change and technologies 
expand into new standards. Keeping up on learning and research is hard enough without having to do research 
about the material that find to do research on the things which you are trying to learn. (*I mean that's painful just to think about really*). Let the Doc docs community do the research.

### How?
First we start by collecting ratings and reviews for online articles and documentation. Anyone will be able to search 
the Doc docs archives for website reviews, but where Doc docs will shine is through browser extensions
which informs users in real time about the quality of the documentation that they are about to read and 
even offers alternatives to the currently loaded article if possible.


Just like on Stack overflow you will be able to see the contribution level of the users who have reviewed
documentation and the "ups" and "downs" voted on their ranking/review by the community members. As time 
progresses the older rating levels will begin to hold less weight over newer ratings, so a user with a 
mid-level trust ranking could offset a user with a high trust ranking if the higher ranked user cast their 
opinion a long time ago. This time factoring will be adjusted more if a document has been branded "outdated"
by the community and
